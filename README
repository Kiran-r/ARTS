# Instructions for installing and running the ARTS RTS

## INSTALLATION

Make sure that you have **gcc 5** or higher and **cmake 2.8** or higher loaded in your environment.

## OBTAIN THE SOURCE CODE

Clone the source repo:

*$ git clone https://github.com/pnnl/ARTS*

This will create a folder called "arts".

## COMPILE

Enter to the arts folder:

*$ cd arts*

Create a build folder and use cmake to build the system:

*$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../*

If everything goes well, you should have the binaries under the build folder.

## TESTING

Copy from the sampleConfigs the arts_puma.cfg to the build/test folder:

*$ cp arts/sampleConfigs/arts.cfg arts/build/examples/arts.cfg*

Afterwards, you can run the test files by using srun (4 nodes 20 worker threads) or mpirun:

*$ srun -N 4 -n 4 -c 20 -p compute ./fib 32*

You can change the number of worker threads using -c on command line or 
change the number of worker threads and network threads in the configure file.
A configure file named arts.cfg located in the CWD is required to run.

The output should read: 

*[0] Using Slurm*

*[0] Fib 32: 2178309 1*

## DOCUMENTATION

Look at **arts.h** and **artsRT.h**
